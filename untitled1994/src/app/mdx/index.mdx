<h1 className="text-2xl mb-2">Reef Loretto</h1>

Reef is an Arab-American musician based in Brooklyn, New York. He was born in
Minneapolis, Minnesota, and moved to Saudi Arabia with his family at the age of
two. He grew up in Dhahran, on an Aramco residential compound near his mother’s
hometown of Dammam.

A unifying theme of his work relates to feeling forever “out of place” in
environments and the pursuit of a secure sense of home.
