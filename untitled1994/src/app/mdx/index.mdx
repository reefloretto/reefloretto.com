# Reef Loretto

Reef is an Arab-American musician based in Brooklyn, New York. He was born in
Minneapolis, Minnesota, and moved to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia with his family at
the age of two. He grew up on an Aramco residential compound near his mother’s
hometown of Dammam. His father was from a small town in Western New York, near
the Niagara River. A unifying theme of his work relates to feeling forever “out
of place” in environments and the pursuit of a secure sense of home.
