# Reef Loretto

Reef is an Arab-American musician based in Brooklyn, New York. He was born in
Minneapolis, Minnesota, and moved to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia with his family at
the age of two. He grew up on an Aramco residential compound near his mother’s
hometown of Dammam, and began to explore songwriting and music production around
the age of 14. His father was from a small town in Western New York. He is the
eldest of three siblings. A unifying theme of his work relates to feeling
consistently “out of place” in environments and the pursuit of a secure sense of
home.
