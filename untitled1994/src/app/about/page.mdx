I'm an Arab-American musician based in Brooklyn, New York.

I was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and moved to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia with my
family at the age of two. I grew up on an Aramco residential compound near my
mother’s hometown of Dammam. My father was from a small town in Western New
York. I'm the eldest of three siblings.

I began to write and produce music around the age of 14 and continued to
dedicate as much attention to the craft of music as possible throughout college
and my software engineering career. A unifying theme of my work relates to
feeling frequently “out of place” in environments and the pursuit of a secure
sense of home.

Thank you for being here.
