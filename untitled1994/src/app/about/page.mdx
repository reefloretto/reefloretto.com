I'm an Arab-American musician based in Brooklyn, New York. I was born in
Minneapolis, Minnesota, and moved to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia with my family at the
age of two. I grew up on an Aramco residential compound near my mother’s
hometown of Dammam, where I began to explore songwriting and music production
around the age of 14. My father was from a small town in Western New York. A
unifying theme of my work relates to feeling consistently “out of place” in
environments and the pursuit of a secure sense of home.
