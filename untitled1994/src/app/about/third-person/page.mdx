Reef Loretto is an Arab-American musician based in Brooklyn, New York.

He was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and moved to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia with
his family at the age of two. He grew up on an Aramco residential compound near
his mother’s hometown of Dammam. His father was from a small town in Western New
York. He's the eldest of three siblings.

Reef began to write and produce music around the age of 14 and continued to
dedicate as much attention to the craft of music as possible throughout college
and his software engineering career. A unifying theme of his work relates to
feeling frequently “out of place” in environments and the pursuit of a secure
sense of home.
